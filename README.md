node-scraper
============

This is a test of scraping technique built in Node + Express + a few plugins.
The markdown is written in *vim*. Look ma! I'm in vim!

Anyway, this test gets information from SITP (public transportation system from Bogot√° Colombia),

What it does
------------
* Scrapes list of bus routes
* Stores list into a JSON
* Scrapes each route into the list (with given url)
* Stores a JSON for each route in first list
* (Coming soon) Stores data in JSON files in a database (MYSQL?)
